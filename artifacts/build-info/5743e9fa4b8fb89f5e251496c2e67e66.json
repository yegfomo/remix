Reggie provides Vera a public key\n @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\n @dev from the output space.\n @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\n @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\n @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness. It ensures 2 things:\n @dev 1. The fulfillment came from the VRFCoordinator\n @dev 2. The consumer contract implements fulfillRandomWords.\n *****************************************************************************\n @dev USAGE\n @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerBase, and can\n @dev initialize VRFConsumerBase's attributes in their constructor as\n @dev shown:\n @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\n @dev     constructor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\n @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator) public {\n @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\n @dev       }\n @dev   }\n @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\n @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash). Create subscription, fund it\n @dev and your consumer contract as a consumer of it (see VRFCoordinatorInterface\n @dev subscription management functions).\n @dev Call requestRandomWords(keyHash, subId, minimumRequestConfirmations,\n @dev callbackGasLimit, numWords),\n @dev see (VRFCoordinatorInterface for a description of the arguments).\n @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\n @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomWords method.\n @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomWords is a set of random words\n @dev generated from your requestId and the blockHash of the request.\n @dev If your contract could have concurrent requests open, you can use the\n @dev requestId returned from requestRandomWords to track which response is associated\n @dev with which randomness request.\n @dev See \"SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\" for principles to keep in mind,\n @dev if your contract could have multiple requests in flight simultaneously.\n @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\n @dev differ.\n *****************************************************************************\n @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n @dev A method with the ability to call your fulfillRandomness method directly\n @dev could spoof a VRF response with any random value, so it's critical that\n @dev it cannot be directly called by anything other than this base contract\n @dev (specifically, by the VRFConsumerBase.rawFulfillRandomness method).\n @dev For your users to trust that your contract's random behavior is free\n @dev from malicious interference, it's best if you can write it so that all\n @dev behaviors implied by a VRF response are executed *during* your\n @dev fulfillRandomness method. If your contract must store the response (or\n @dev anything derived from it) and use it later, you must ensure that any\n @dev user-significant behavior which depends on that stored value cannot be\n @dev manipulated by a subsequent VRF request.\n @dev Similarly, both miners and the VRF oracle itself have some influence\n @dev over the order in which VRF responses appear on the blockchain, so if\n @dev your contract could have multiple VRF requests in flight simultaneously,\n @dev you must ensure that the order in which the VRF responses arrive cannot\n @dev be used to manipulate your contract's user-significant behavior.\n @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness\n @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n @dev to the VRF. However, such an attack would incur a substantial economic\n @dev cost. This cost scales with the number of blocks the VRF oracle waits\n @dev until it calls responds to a request. It is for this reason that\n @dev that you can signal to an oracle you'd like them to wait longer before\n @dev responding to the request (however this is not enforced in the contract\n @dev and so remains effective only in the case of unmodified oracle software)."
